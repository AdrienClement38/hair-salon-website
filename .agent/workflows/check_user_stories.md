description: Check if changes impact User Stories before proceeding
---
1. Read `USER_STORIES.md` to refresh memory on core functionalities.
2. Cross-reference the requested changes with the User Stories.
   - Ask yourself: "Does this change delete, break, or contradict an existing US?"
   - Ask yourself: "Does this change affect a critical path (Booking, Login, Settings)?"
3. If there is a risk, verify with the user or ensure backward compatibility.
4. Proceed only if the integrity of User Stories is preserved.
